Through synthetic mixture-of-experts styled data generating process, we analyze typical modular systems and uncover their sub-optimality through the lens of collapse and specialization metrics proposed. We uncover the benefits of optimal specialization, whether typical modular systems achieve it as well as its trends with increasing number of modules and experts.
