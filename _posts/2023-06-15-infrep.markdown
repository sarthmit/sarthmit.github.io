Diffusion models can be equipped to do representation learning and lead to infinite-dimensional trajectory-based representations for static objects like images. We provide a thorough analysis into the kind of semantics that are encoded in different parts of this trajectory representation and provide attention-based methods to automatically filter important parts of the representation based on a given discretization scheme.
