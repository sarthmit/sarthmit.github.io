We propose <i>BRIMs: Bidirectional Recurrent Independent Mechanisms</i> which is an attention-based modular system that allows efficient combination of top-down and bottom-up signals for robust prediction. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of dynamic modulation of top-down and bottom-up signals on benchmarks across a variety of domains.
